To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty uses these data sources to detect anomalies involving the following AWS resource types: 
IAM access keys, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and Amazon EKS resources. While in transit from these data sources to GuardDuty, all of the log data is encrypted.
GuardDuty extracts various fields from these logs for profiling and anomaly detection, and then discards the logs.
