1-
	A- Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): By requiring users to provide a second authentication factor in addition to their password, 2FA can add an additional layer of security to accounts.
	B- Patch and update web applications regularly to ensure vulnerabilities are addressed (e.g., web server, database server, and programming language).
	C- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN can be used to cache static assets (e.g., images, CSS, and JavaScript files) and distribute them to multiple edge locations. 
	   This can help reduce the load on the web application instance and mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks.

2- yes. Creating VPC private endpoints for S3 can potentially help prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket, even if the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure.
Through VPC endpoints for S3, traffic between instances in your VPC and S3 is routed within the Amazon network rather than over the Internet. Traffic cannot leave the Amazon network,
providing additional security by reducing the attack surface for potential attackers.

3- No. The default encryption setting applies only to new objects uploaded to the bucket

4- If the Original cloud formations yaml files are applied at this stage, we will get the following errors:
