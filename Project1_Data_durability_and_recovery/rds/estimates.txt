The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for our multi-AZ database in AWS RDS depends on several factors,
including the type of database, the size of the database, and the infrastructure that is used to support the database.
However, it is important to understand that the actual RTO will depend on various factors such as network latency, 
storage I/O performance, and other infrastructure factors. Additionally, the RTO may be impacted by the configuration of the database,
such as the use of provisioned IOPS or other performance-enhancing features. 
In our primary instace (MySQL Multy-AZ) in case of a Single AZ outage the RTO can be less than 5 minutes ,and in case of Region outage the RTO can be between 5 to 10 minutes.

The minimum RPO for a single AZ outage would typically be seconds, as data is constantly being 
replicated between Availability Zones within the same region. The minimum RPO for a single region
outage would likely be a few minutes, as data is replicated between regions, but there may be a delay
before the most recent data is available. It's important to note that these figures can be influenced 
by several factors, including network latency, database load, and the size of the data set being replicated.
for our main Instance(MySQL multi-AZ) the RPO could be few seconds in case of Single AZ outage, and in case of Region Outage
the RPO could be between 30 minutes to few hours
