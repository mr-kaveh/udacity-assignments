The EC2 instance is using an AMI ID that is hardcoded in the template. It's better to use parameterized AMI IDs or use the latest version
of the AMI to reduce the chances of running an instance with known security vulnerabilities.

The EC2 instance's user data includes environment variables for S3 bucket names and secrets. It's better to store these secrets in a secure parameter store or a secrets
manager and use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to them.

The security group rules for the "AppLoadBalancerSG" allow any IP address to access port 80, which can make the load balancer vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks or other exploits.
It's better to limit the access to specific IP addresses or ranges.
